# Obsidian uW RC Link Opener

Opens the file locally that an  RC links in a Markdown file refers to, creating it if it doesn't exist

## How to use:

Make a directory that will be your vault (or use an existing one)

In that vault directory, from the command line, use git to clone en_tw:

```
git clone https://git.door43.org/unfoldingword/en_tw.git
```

Open the vault directory in Obsidian which should add a hidden .obsidian/ directory in the vault's root directory.

On the command line:

```
cd .obsidian
mkdir plugins
cd plugins
```

Now clone this repo here:

```
git clone https://github.com/unfoldingword-dev/obsidian-uw-rc-link-opener.git
```

Go into the Vault's settings, turn on community plugins, and then turn on this plugin in the list of community plugins that have been installed.
